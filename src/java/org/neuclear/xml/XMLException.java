 * $Log: XMLException.java,v $
 * Revision 1.2  2003/11/21 04:44:31  pelle
 * EncryptedFileStore now works. It uses the PBECipher with DES3 afair.
 * Otherwise You will Finaliate.
 * Anything that can be final has been made final throughout everyting. We've used IDEA's Inspector tool to find all instance of variables that could be final.
 * This should hopefully make everything more stable (and secure).
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2003/11/11 16:33:20  pelle
 * Moved over from neudist.org
 * Moved remaining common utilities into commons
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/10/21 22:30:33  pelle
 * Renamed NeudistException to NeuClearException and moved it to org.neuclear.commons where it makes more sense.
 * Unhooked the XMLException in the xmlsig library from NeuClearException to make all of its exceptions an independent hierarchy.
 * Obviously had to perform many changes throughout the code to support these changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2003/01/18 18:12:31  pelle
 * First Independent commit of the Independent XML-Signature API for NeuDist.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/09/21 23:11:16  pelle
 * A bunch of clean ups. Got rid of as many hard coded URL's as I could.
