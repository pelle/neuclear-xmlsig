            <p>
                [November 11th, 2003] NeuDist XMLSig is now NeuClear XMLSig.
                Several minor improvements through the code, but the big news is
                that most code unrelated to XML has been moved into the sister
                library <a href="http://neuclear.org/commons/">NeuClear Commons</a> library.
                Making this a required library now.
            </p>

                Thanks to <a href="mailto:ramses@computer.org">Ramses Morales</a> for lots of help with this release.
                Ramses has been added as developer/comitter on the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                An other small feature is a simple SOAP Client and Server implementation, which will probably be pulled out into
                its own project soon.

        <section name="NeuDist XMLSig API split out.">
            <p>
                [January 20th, 2003] As of today the XMLSig API has been split out of the main NeuClear Framework.
                This is to make it easier to develop seperately and to hopefully allow other people to useit.
            </p>
        </section>
		<section name="Introduction">
			<p>
                XML Signature API is a simple implementation of the XML-Signature standard from <a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a>.
                The main difference of this over Apache's implementation is that it uses Dom4J and hopefully should be faster. This has never been verified
                so take it with a grain of salt.
            </p>
