            <p>
                The four main requirements for the library is:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org">Bouncy Castle Crypto</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.dom4j.org">Dom4J</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://dev.neuclear.org/commons/">NeuClear Commons</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/">JTidy</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/mxp1/">MXP1 XPP3 Parser (Recommended)</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                With Dom4J make sure you include the full jar in your classpath.
                If you plan on using the SOAP Servlet functionality of the library you also will need to have the
                servlet api in your path.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Bouncy Castle Crypto you need a JCE and a crypto provider.
                If you're using JDK1.4 you will allready have a JCE. Otherwise the easiest thing todo is to get their combined JCE/Provider.
                I would also recommend getting the signed jar for your version of the JDK and install it as an extension in
                <tt>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext</tt>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also will need to edit your
                <tt>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security</tt> file as well. Adding the following line:
            </p>
            <source>security.provider.6=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider </source>
            <p>Making sure to change the 6 to whatever the last number is in the sequence of providers</p>

                To build anything within the NeuClear framework you first need to install
                <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>.
                Follow their installation instructions and you should be ok. I haven't tried this under windows yet, but I'm guessing
                it should work fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maven fetches all the required libraries you need the first time you attempt to build it.
            </p>
            <p>
                First checkout the source from CVS:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/> cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/neuclear login
~/projects/> cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/neuclear co neuclear-xmlsig
~/projects/> cd neuclear-xmlsig </source>
            <p>
                Familiarise yourself a bit with maven. It's a bit different than ant, but
                very easy to learn. To see the options available go to the type:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/neuclear-xmlsig> maven -g</source>
            <p>
                Of these the most important one is to simply type:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/neuclear-xmlsig> maven jar:install</source>
            <p>
                If you use
                <a href="http://intellij.com">IntelliJ IDEA</a> maven will create a project file for you automatically:
            </p>
            <source>~/projects/neuclear-xmlsig> maven idea</source>
